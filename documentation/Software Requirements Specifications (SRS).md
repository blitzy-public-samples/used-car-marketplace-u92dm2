    style P fill:#fbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

This flowchart outlines the main processes for both sellers and buyers in the Used Car Marketplace:

1. The user visits the website, implemented using React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.

2. The user is identified as either a seller or a buyer.

3. For Sellers:
   - They upload car photos, which are processed by the AI vision model (e.g., Moondream).
   - The AI extracts vehicle details, which the user verifies or corrects.
   - The seller uploads maintenance documents, which are processed by the AI.
   - The seller sets a listing price, and the listing is generated and added to the database.

4. For Buyers:
   - They can search listings using the advanced search functionality.
   - They view search results and can select individual listings for more details.
   - If they decide to purchase, the payment is processed via the Stripe integration.
   - Upon successful payment, a PDF receipt is generated, and the listing is removed from the marketplace.

The backend processes, including AI analysis, document processing, and database operations, are implemented in Python for optimal performance and integration with AI libraries.

This flowchart provides a high-level overview of the system's main processes, illustrating the user journey for both sellers and buyers, and highlighting the key AI-powered features that set this marketplace apart from traditional platforms.
