### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could impact the budget, and we have strategies in place to manage these risks:

1. AI Model Performance:
   - Risk: The chosen AI vision model may require additional fine-tuning or a more powerful alternative.
   - Mitigation: We've allocated extra hours for the AI/ML specialist and included a contingency budget.

2. Scalability Challenges:
   - Risk: As the platform grows, infrastructure costs may increase more rapidly than anticipated.
   - Mitigation: We'll implement cost-optimization strategies and regularly review cloud resource allocation.

3. Regulatory Compliance:
   - Risk: Changes in data protection or vehicle sales regulations may require additional development work.
   - Mitigation: We've included a buffer in the development hours and will stay informed about relevant regulations.

4. Third-Party Service Changes:
   - Risk: Stripe or other integrated services may change their APIs or pricing structures.
   - Mitigation: We'll design with modularity in mind to allow for easier service swaps if necessary.

5. Scope Creep:
   - Risk: Client requests for additional features may expand the project scope.
   - Mitigation: We'll use a change request process and adjust the budget and timeline accordingly for any approved changes.

6. Security Vulnerabilities:
   - Risk: The security audit may uncover issues requiring significant additional work.
   - Mitigation: We've allocated ample time for security-focused development and included a post-audit buffer.

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Risk: Achieving the desired system performance may require more optimization than initially estimated.
   - Mitigation: We've included performance testing in our QA process and allocated time for optimization work.

8. Exchange Rate Fluctuations:
   - Risk: For any international expenses, currency fluctuations could impact costs.
   - Mitigation: We'll use forward contracts or set aside a small forex contingency if applicable.

9. Talent Availability:
   - Risk: Difficulty in finding specialized AI talent could delay the project or increase costs.
   - Mitigation: We have a network of contractors we can engage if needed, and have factored this into our contingency.

10. Hardware Costs:
    - Risk: Testing on a wide range of devices could incur additional hardware costs.
    - Mitigation: We've included a budget for testing devices and will utilize emulators where possible.

By carefully monitoring these potential issues and maintaining open communication with the client, we aim to deliver the project within the proposed budget while meeting all specified requirements.
